## A Preatrained VAE Model to generate faces

Now this repos is maybe too psedu but anyways lets talk about little bit VAE intro and the results

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of artificial neural network model used in machine learning and deep learning. VAEs are a type of generative model designed to learn and represent complex probability distributions over data, often used for tasks such as image generation, data compression, and data generation.

VAEs combine ideas from traditional autoencoders and probabilistic modeling. An autoencoder is a type of neural network architecture that learns to encode input data into a compact representation (encoding) and then decode it back into the original data (reconstruction), effectively learning a compressed representation of the input data. However, traditional autoencoders lack a probabilistic interpretation.

In contrast, VAEs introduce a probabilistic component to the encoding and decoding processes, making them capable of generating new data points that share similarities with the training data. The key innovation of VAEs is that they learn a probabilistic distribution over the latent space (the compressed representation) rather than just a deterministic point.
